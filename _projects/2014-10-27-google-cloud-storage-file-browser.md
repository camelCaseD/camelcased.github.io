This is a Google Cloud Storage File Browser created for a local church so that members of the church could upload various media files to share from events in the church. The site was protected by a password that was shared with some people to post the media in.<br />

The overall design was based off Material design with red as the main color

The layout was tabbed based and split by the three main functions of the file manager

All of this was acheived using [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) to help with the use of Material design and a component based UI
