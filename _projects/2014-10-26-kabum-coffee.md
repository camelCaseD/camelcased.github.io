[Kabum Coffee Interantional](http://kabum.org) is a company with the goal of rewarding farmers that produce quality coffee beans to help them overcome poverty.

I developed an android app that shows the farmers that are in the program. The goal of the application was to have it shown to reatilers allowing for them to pick which farmer they wanted to buy coffee from. While also providing a face and story with the coffee they purchase. The application feeds of an API that I also had to create in order for the application to pull data from a Microsoft SQL database.<br />

The list includes the farmer's name, cupping score, and a pic of them.<br />

A more detailed view of the farmer also included biography and more details of their cupping scores.
