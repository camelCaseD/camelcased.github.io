summary: A PHP Library for parsing Inbound Hooks for Postmark App.
---
[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) is a cloud email service provider. This [project](https://github.com/camelCaseD/postmark-inbound-laravel) lets you parse the JSON Postmark provides for your server via an inbound hook. The JSON is then abstracted into easy to use PHP data models/classes for you to use within a [Laravel](http://laravel.com) project.

I had developed the library as part of an early setup of my email system after purchasing camelcased.com.
