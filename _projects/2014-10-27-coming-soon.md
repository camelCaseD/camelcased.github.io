Oasis is the coming soon page I created for this site. It was designed to look like a computer trying to bootup but fails to do so. At which pint a fake AI named Oasis will appear and greet you when the machine fails to boot. The source code for the project can be found on [Github](http://github.com/camelCaseD/comingSoon).<br />
