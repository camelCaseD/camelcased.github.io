I'm Brandon B. a student from Oregon. I enjoy creating/programming web sites and mobile apps. The alias `camelCaseD` came about because of how some code styles use **camelCase** for variable, class, and method/function names. The "D" on the end stands simply for developer and because at the time of purchasing this domain camelcase was already taken. Feel free to look at my blog posts or my portfolio for examples of work I've done.

I also have strong interest in the language 中文. It has always fascinated me as language that compared to the latin alphabet how it has so many different symbols when combined together can form words and phrases. 我已经历时二年中文课的。
