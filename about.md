I'm Brandon B. a student from Oregon. I enjoy creating/programming web sites and mobile apps. The alias `camelCaseD` came about because of how some code styles use **camelCase** for variable, class, and method/function names. The "D" on the end stands simply for developer and because at the time of purchasin this domain camelcase was already taken. Feel free to look at my blog posts or my portfolio for examples of work I've done.
